# DJMAX RESPECT RANDOMIZER

A very crappy-looking song randomizer for DJMAX RESPECT V

Purely made with Google Gemini. I don't know how to code but I somehow know what I need to do to make it happen. xd

Will update the song list from time to time because yes. xd

You can either download the source code and run it yourself from there or just download the exe version so you don't have to install python, I guess.
