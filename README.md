# DJMAX RESPECT RANDOMIZER

A very crappy-looking song randomizer for DJMAX RESPECT V

Purely made with Google Gemini. I don't know how to code but I somehow know what I need to do to make it happen. xd

This is heavily inspired from the randomizer that I found out there but that one has beautiful UI and usage design. It's just that, I hate the RNG of its song selection and it is quite buggy but knowing how this thing took me, it's just very understandable.

Will update the song list from time to time because yes. xd

You can either download the source code and run it yourself from there or just download the exe version so you don't have to install python, I guess.



# FEATURES
- Separated NM/HD/MX from SC since they have different difficulty scales.
- Filter by DLC that you own. Make sure to toggle those DLCs that you own or you wanna play.
- Randomizer history.
- Key Mode filter.


# USAGE
1. Toggle all the DLCs that you own or you wanna play
2. Select the Key Mode that you want to play
3. Toggle the Difficulty and adjust the levels of the charts that you want to see.
4. Click "Get Random Song"
5. Choose the song in your game (if you want to play that)
6. Profit. xd


# KNOWN ISSUES
- the redundant ahh all categories button
- you can only select specific button mode. it will not allow you to use all key mode.
- ugly-ass UI design. I don't know. I'm just happy that it is working (it's an excuse because I don't know how to work on it)
- skill issue (that's me xd)


# EXTRAS
- If you want to update the list on your own, you can use this spreadsheet for your reference.
